<h1> Stage Zero</b>
<h2><b>Important Concepts</b></h2>
<b>How the web works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. A web browser on your computer communicates with the server with HTTP. The server frinds the correct HTML document and sends it back to your browser. The computer interprets the page and
  displays it on your screen.</p>

<em>The web is a collection of HTML pages.</em>

<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the basis for everything on the web.</p>
<p>HTML is made of:
  <br> *text content = what you see
  <br> *Markup = what it looks like
  <br> *References to other docs = eg. images and videos
  <br> *Links to other pages </p>
<b>HTML Markups</b>
<br>
<br>
< name> contents
  < / name>
    <br>
    <br> Opening tags -
    < name>
      <br> Closing tags -
      < / name>

        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Common Markups </em>
        <br>
        <br>
        < b> = bold</b>
          <br>
          < em> = italics
            <br>
            < a> = anchor is for making links
              <br>
              < img> = images
                <br>
                < br> = line breaks. <em> Like the enter key when typing for a new line. <br></em>
                  <br>


                  <b>Inline vs Block</B>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p> Inline are tags that are displayed without line breaks. Block tags have an invisible box around them, and normally start and end with a new line. The following are inline elements: a, br, em, b, img, span The following are block elements:
                    p, div, and form.
                  </p>
              <br>
              <b>HTTP</b> <br><br>
              HTTP is browser communication between servers

                  <b> HTML document example</b>

                  <br>
                  <br>
              
              < ! Doctype html > - doctype= what kind of html it is. <br>
                < html > - surrounds entire document <br>
                  < head > - meta data like java and CSS <br>
                    < title > title < / title > - title of page <br>
                      < / head> <br> 
                        < body > contents of document <br>
                          contents <br>
                          < / body > <br>
                            < /html > <br>

                              <em> What is a web page?</em><br><br>
                              A web page is a text document written in HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language. Web browsers read these documents, then interpret and display them.<br><br>
                              
                              <em> How does coding work?</em><br><br>
                              Programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. <br><br>
                              
                              <em>Computers are stupid!</em><br><br>
                              Don't forget to close tags! The computer thinks literally, and won't catch mistakes.<br><br>
                              
                              <em>Progammers can't remember everything!</em><br><br> 
                                Use google or ask for help if you are stuck. <br><br>
